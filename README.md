### Breast Cancer Tumor Prediction Tool

## Overview

Breast cancer affects approximately 13% of women in the United States and remains a significant health concern. Our project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the malignancy of breast masses based on cell nuclei characteristics. 

The dataset comprises 569 samples, with features derived from digitized images of fine needle aspirates of breast masses. These features characterize cell nuclei. The diagnosis column serves as the target variable, while the identity (ID) column, used for identification, will be omitted. Initially, our unoptimized model will utilize 30 features, which will be refined through optimization to enhance model performance.

**Key attributes in this dataset include:**

- ID number
- Diagnosis (M = malignant, B = benign), our target variable.
- Various numerical features such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension, computed from digitized images of FNA. Numerical Features are explained further below
+ Radius: Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
+ Texture: Standard deviation of gray-scale values
+ Perimeter
+ Area
+ Smoothness: Local variation in radius lengths
+ Compactness: PerimeterÂ² / area - 1.0
+ Concavity: Severity of concave portions of the contour
+ Concave points: Number of concave portions of the contour
+ Symmetry
+ Fractal dimension: "Coastline approximation" - 1
  
Note: The ID column is excluded from the analysis as it is used only for identification.

Our analysis aims to leverage these attributes to develop a robust prediction tool for early diagnosis of breast cancer.

**Breast Cancer Overview**

According to the American Cancer Society, breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast grow uncontrollably. These cells often form a tumor that can be detected via an x-ray or felt as a lump. The tumor is considered malignant (cancerous) if the cells can invade surrounding tissues or spread to other parts of the body. While breast cancer primarily affects women, men can also develop the disease.

**Dataset Application**

The dataset contains diagnoses of lumps and masses found in patients, classifying them as either malignant (denoted by 'M') or benign (denoted by 'B'). This project will use these classifications to train and evaluate machine learning models, aiming to accurately predict the diagnosis based on the provided attributes.

For the SVM model, we explored several less optimal versions before finalizing the optimized version that delivered the best performance.
